Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming, also called OOP, is a model for writing computer programs. Before OOP, most programs were a list of instructions that acted on memory in the computer. Instead of a procedural list of actions, OOP is modeled around objects that interact with each other. Classes generate objects and define their structure, like a blueprint. The objects interact with each other to carry out the intent of the computer program.

Many design patterns have been written utilizing OOP principles for code reuse.

OOP has become popular, but many people criticize it.

Luca Cardelli wrote a paper titled 'Bad Engineering Properties of Object-Oriented Languages'.
