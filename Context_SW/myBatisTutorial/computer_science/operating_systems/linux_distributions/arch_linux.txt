Arch Linux

Arch Linux (usually just called Arch) is a Linux-based operating system for 32-bit and 64-bit computers. It mostly has free software included with it, and supports community involvement.

Arch Linux focuses on elegance, code correctness, minimalism, and simplicity, and to use it, the user needs to have a motive to learn about it. A package manager made only for Arch Linux named "pacman" can be used to install, remove and update packages of software on the computer.
