Windows 10

Windows 10 is a computer operating system by Microsoft as part of its Windows family of operating systems. It was known as Threshold when it was being developed and announced at a press event on 30 September 2014. It came out for PCs on July 29, 2015. Beginning on that day, Windows 10 was available as a free upgrade for users running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 for one year.

Windows 10 is designed to provide a common, "universal" user experience between desktop, laptop, and all-in-one PCs, tablet computers, smartphones, and embedded systems such as its Xbox game console. Many of its features have been added based upon feedback from users, who are testing the software before it is released.
