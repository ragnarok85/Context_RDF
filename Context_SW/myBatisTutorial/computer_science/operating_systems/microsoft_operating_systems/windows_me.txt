Windows Me

Windows Me is the Millennium Edition of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Windows Me is based on Windows 98. Windows Me was based on MS-DOS (as were Windows 98 and Windows 95), and is meant for people using computers in their homes. Windows 2000 and Windows Me are similar in looks, but Windows Me has features that families find useful, while Windows 2000 was meant for businesses, although many home users also used Windows 2000 especially after Windows Me got bad reviews. It was released near the year 2000 because it was the Third Millennium, calling it Windows Millennium Edition. It was the last Windows to be based in MS-DOS. Unlike Windows 2000, Windows Me generally got negative reviews due to bugs and incompatible hardware. Support and updates for Windows Me (and Windows 98) ended in 2006, whereas Windows 2000 was supported until 2010.
