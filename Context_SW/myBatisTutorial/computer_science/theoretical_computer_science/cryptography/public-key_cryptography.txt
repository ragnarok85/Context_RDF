Public-key cryptography

Public-key cryptography, also called asymmetric cryptography, is a communication where people exchange messages that can only be read by one another. 

In public key cryptography, each user has a pair of cryptographic keys:
The private key is kept secret, while the public key may be widely distributed and used by other users. 

Incoming messages are encrypted with the "recipient's public key" and can only be decrypted with their corresponding private key. The keys are related mathematically, but the user's private key cannot be easily got from the widely used public key.

The two main branches of public key cryptography are:

There are still a few problems with this method but most of them are due to human error.
