Structured program theorem

The structured program theorem is a theory in programming and computer science. A computer program can be split into pieces of code that do a certain task. According to the structured program theory, these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways to get any larger task done.

A program gets a large task done by splitting it into many smaller tasks that the computer can do easily. These smaller tasks are called "subprograms" in computer science. According to the structured program theorem, the three ways subprograms can be combined are:
The theorem was first published in 1966 by Corrado BÃ¶hm and Guiseppe Jacopini. It comes from the 1946 description of the von Neumann architecture and the normal form theorem developed by Stephen Kleene.
