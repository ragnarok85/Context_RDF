Nearest neighbour algorithm

Nearest neighbour algorithms is a the name given to a number of greedy algorithms to solve problems related to graph theory. This algorithm was made to find a solution to the travelling salesman problem. In general, these algorithms try to find a Hamlitonian cycle as follows:
Such algorithms are easy to implement, but they do not always find the best solution. What is worse, the algorithm may not find a tour even if one exists.
