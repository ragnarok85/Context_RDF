Linear search

Linear search or sequential search is an algorithm to find an item in a list. It's a search algorithm.

Start out with a list, L which may have the item in question.

In the programming language Java, linear search looks like this. This method has two parameters: an array of integers and the item we are looking for (also an integer). It says the location in the array if it finds the item. If it does not find it, it says -1.
