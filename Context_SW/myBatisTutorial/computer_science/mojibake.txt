Mojibake

When problems like these appear, the reason is that when transferring text on the internet, it is actually sent as numbers (bytes). For example, "A" is sent as 65. There are not enough numbers to handle all letters in all languages when using bytes. Only the numbers 0-255 are usually available. Therefore every language has its own interpretation of these numbers. Often the computers misunderstand what the meaning of a number (a byte) is.

Mojibake is a Japanese word. The word 文字化け () is composed of two parts. 文字 ("moji") means "letter", "character". 化け ("bake"), from the verb 化ける ("bakeru"), means "to appear in disguise, to take the form of, to change for the worse". Literally, it means "character mutation".
