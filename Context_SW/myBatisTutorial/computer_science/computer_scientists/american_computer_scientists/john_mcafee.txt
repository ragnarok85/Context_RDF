John McAfee

John David McAfee (born September 18, 1945) is an American computer programmer. He is the developer of the first commercial anti-virus program. This bore the McAfee brand-name for years, until it was bought by Intel and given the Intel name. 

McAfee was born in an U.S. Army base stationed in the United Kingdom. He was raised in Virginia and Alabama.

His wealth peaked at $100 million, before his investments suffered in the global crisis of 2007. McAfee also has interests in smartphone apps, yoga and all-natural antibiotics. 

On September 8, 2015, McAfee announced that he would seek the office of President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election as the candidate of a newly formed political party called the Cyber Party. On December 24, 2015 he re-announced his candidacy bid, saying that he would instead seek the Libertarian nomination for President.
