Grace Hopper

Grace Murray Hopper (December 9 1906 â€“ January 1 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy officer. 

She was one of the first people to work with modern digital computers and the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I calculator. She developed the first compiler for a computer programming language.

She had the idea that programs could be written in a language that was close to English rather than in machine code or languages (such as assembly language) close to machine code, which is how it was normally done at that time. COBOL language was based very much on her philosophy.

A park in Arlington, Virginia is named in her honor. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) was named for her.

On December 9 2013 Google had an animation of Hopper for their Google Doodle.
