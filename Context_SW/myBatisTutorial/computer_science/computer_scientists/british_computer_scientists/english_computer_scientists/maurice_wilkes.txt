Professor Sir Maurice Vincent Wilkes (26 June 1913, Dudley, Worcestershire â€” 29 November 2010) was a British computer scientist, called the "father of Brish computing". 

He invented the first usable stored program computer called EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator) at Cambridge University in 1949.
