Kate (text editor)

Kate is a text editor for the KDE desktop environment. The name is an acronym for "KDE Advanced Text Editor." It was first put in the KDE 2.2 release, on August 15, 2002.

The "advanced text editor" part of its name refers to its many abilities. It can do many more things than a simpler text editor, like Notepad, but it does not have some of the important features of a word processor (compare it with KWord). Some important features of Kate include a checker for proper spelling, a thesaurus, and highlighting of computer programming code.
