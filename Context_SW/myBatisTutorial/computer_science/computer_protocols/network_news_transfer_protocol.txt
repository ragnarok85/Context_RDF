Network News Transfer Protocol

The Network News Transfer Protocol is a computer protocol that was used to create groups that could exchange news articles between people. It is not in very common usage now, but was commonly used in the late 1980s and 1990s. Many internet service providers still provide a NNTP server for their customers, and commerical Usenet services exist.
