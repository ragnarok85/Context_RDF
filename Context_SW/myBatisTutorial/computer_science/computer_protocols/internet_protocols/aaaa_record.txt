AAAA record

In the Domain Name System, an AAAA record is something that changes a domain name into a 128-bit IP address (or "IPv6 address"). A domain can have many AAAA records, for example, the domain "example.com" could have an AAAA record for "www.example.com" that points to the IP "2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652", and another AAAA record for "mail.example.com" that points to the IP "2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9653".
