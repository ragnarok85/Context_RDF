List of Internet Relay Chat commands

This is a list of all Internet Relay Chat commands from IETF RFCs 1459 and 2812. Most IRC clients need commands to have a slash ("/") before the command. Angle brackets ("<" and ">") mean what's placed in the secondary field, not a literal part of the command. Settings encapsulated in square brackets ("[" and "]") are optional and override the command's defaults.

Syntax:

Instructs the server to return information about the administrator of the server specified by <target>, or the current server if target is omitted.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Provides the server with a message to automatically send in reply to a PRIVMSG directed at the user, but not to a channel they are on.
If <message> is omitted, the away status is removed.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Instructs the server <remote server> (or the current server, if <remote server> is omitted) to connect to <target server> on port <port>.
This command should only be available to IRC Operators.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>; the <port> parameter became mandatory in <nowiki>RFC 2812</nowiki>

Syntax:

Instructs the server to shut down.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 2812</nowiki>

Syntax:

This command is for use by servers to report errors to other servers. It is also used before terminating client connections.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Returns information about the <target> server, or the current server if <target> is omitted. Information returned includes the server's version, when it was compiled, the patch level, when it was started, and any other information which may be considered to be relevant.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Invites <nickname> to the channel <channel>. <channel> does not have to exist, but if it does, only members of the channel are allowed to invite other clients. If the channel mode i is set, only channel operators may invite other clients.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Queries the server to see if the clients in the space-separated list <nicknames> are currently on the network. The server returns only the nicknames that are on the network in a space-separated list. If none of the clients are on the network the server returns an empty list.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Makes the client join the channels in the comma-separated list <channels>, specifying the passwords, if needed, in the comma-separated list <keys>. If the channel(s) do not exist then they will be created.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Forcibly removes <client> from <channel>. This command may only be issued by channel operators.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Forcibly removes <client> from the network. This command may only be issued by IRC operators.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Lists all server links matching <server mask>, if given, on <remote server>, or the current server if omitted.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Lists all channels on the server. If the comma-separated list <channels> is given, it will return the channel topics. If <server> is given, the command will be forwarded to <server> for evaluation.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Returns statistics about the size of the network. If called with no arguments, the statistics will reflect the entire network. If <mask> is given, it will return only statistics reflecting the masked subset of the network. If <target> is given, the command will be forwarded to <server> for evaluation.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 2812</nowiki>

Syntax:

The MODE command is dual-purpose. It can be used to set both user and channel modes.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Returns the message of the day on <server> or the current server if it is omitted.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 2812</nowiki>

Syntax:

Returns a list of who is on the comma-separated list of <channels>, by channel name. If <channels> is omitted, all users are shown, grouped by channel name with all users who are not on a channel being shown as part of channel "*". If <server> is specified, the command is sent to <server> for evaluation.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>; the optional <server> parameter was added in <nowiki>RFC 2812</nowiki>

Syntax:

Allows a client to change their IRC nickname. Hopcount is for use between servers to specify how far away a nickname is from its home server.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>; the optional <hopcount> parameter was removed in <nowiki>RFC 2812</nowiki>

Syntax:

This command works similarly to PRIVMSG, except automatic replies must never be sent in reply to NOTICE messages.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Authenticates a user as an IRC operator on that server/network.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Sets a connection password. This command must be sent before the NICK/USER registration combination.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Tests the presence of a connection. A PING message results in a PONG reply. If <server2> is specified, the message gets passed on to it.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

This command is a reply to the PING command and works in much the same way.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Sends <message> to <msgtarget>, which is usually a user or channel.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Lists the services currently on the network.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 2812</nowiki>

Syntax:

The server message is used to tell a server that the other end of a new connection is a server. This message is also used to pass server data over whole net.
<hopcount> details how many hops (server connections) away <servername> is.
<info> contains addition human-readable information about the server.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Trace a path across the IRC network to a specific server or client, in a similar method to traceroute.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

Syntax:

Returns the version of <server>, or the current server if omitted.

Defined in <nowiki>RFC 1459</nowiki>

If given, the server will return information from the last <count> times the nickname has been used. If <server> is given, the command is forwarded to it for processing. In <nowiki>RFC 2812</nowiki>, <nickname> can be a comma-separated list of nicknames.
