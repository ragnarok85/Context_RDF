Unreachable code

Unreachable code is a section of code in a program that can never be executed. 

Having unreachable code is bad because it wastes space on the disk, memory, and CPU cache.

Luckily, many modern compilers alert the programmer with a warning or error whenever it detects unreachable code.

In this example, ":'(" will never be printed because the loop never exits.
