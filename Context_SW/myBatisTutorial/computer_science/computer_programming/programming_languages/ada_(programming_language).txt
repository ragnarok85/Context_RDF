Ada (programming language)

Ada is a computer programming language. It was invented by Jean Ichbiah during the 1980s. It is very similar to the programming language Pascal. Ada offers various features to make a programme as safe as possible. That is why it is often used in systems, where an error can be very dangerous. Ada is an international standard.

Example of a Hello world program in Ada:

with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Hello is
begin
end Hello;
