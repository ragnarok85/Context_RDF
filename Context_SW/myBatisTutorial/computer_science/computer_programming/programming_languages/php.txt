PHP

PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a scripting language that helps people make web pages more interactive by allowing them to do more things. 

A website programmed with PHP can have pages that are password protected. A website with no programming cannot do this without other complex things. Standard PHP file extensions are: .php .php3 or .phtml, but a web server can be set up to use any extension.

Its structure was influenced by many languages like C, Perl, Java, C++, and even Python. It is considered to be free software by the Free Software Foundation.

Wikipedia, which runs on MediaWiki, uses the PHP scripting language.

PHP was first created by a man called Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995. It is now developed and improved by a large team of people.

An example Hello World program:
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";

It is common to put PHP code inside a HTML document, for example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
