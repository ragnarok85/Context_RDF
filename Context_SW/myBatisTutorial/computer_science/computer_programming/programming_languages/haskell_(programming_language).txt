Haskell (programming language)

Haskell is a purely functional programming language. It is named after Haskell Brooks Curry, a U.S. mathematician who contributed a lot to logic. Haskell is based on lambda calculus and uses the Greek letter lambda as its logo. The main implementations are the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), and Hugs, a Haskell interpreter. 

The following is an example Hello World program in Haskell:

module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
One way to create an infinite list of Fibonacci numbers is this:

fib n = fibs !! n

Haskel was influenced by many earlier programming languages. These were Clean, FP, Gofer, Hope and Hope, Id, ISWIM, KRC, Lisp, Miranda, ML and Standard ML, Orwell, SASL, SISAL, and Scheme.

Haskell itself has influenced many later programming languages, such as Agda, Bluespec, C++11/Concepts, C#/LINQ, Cayenne, Clean, Clojure, CoffeeScript, Curry, F#, Isabelle, Java/Generics, Mercury, Perl 6, Python, Scala, Visual Basic 9.0.
