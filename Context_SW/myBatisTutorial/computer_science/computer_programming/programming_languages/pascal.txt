Pascal

Pascal is a programming language. It was created in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth, to help people learn how to make computer programs.

Now, there are many different dialects of the language, so a Pascal program written for one compiler can not easily be used with another one.

This code prints "Hello world" at console window

program helloworld;
begin
end.
This code calculate factorial of positive integer, using recursion.

program fac;
var j:integer;
function fact(i:integer):integer ;
begin
end ;

begin
end.
