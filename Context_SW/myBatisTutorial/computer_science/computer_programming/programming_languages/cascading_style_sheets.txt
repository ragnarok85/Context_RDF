Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, are a way to change the look of HTML and XHTML web pages. CSS was designed by the W3C, and is supported well by most modern web browsers. The current version of CSS is CSS3. CSS4 is available, but is split into parts 

One advantage to using CSS is a web page can still be displayed and understood, even if the CSS is not working or removed.

CSS code is saved in files with the .css file extension.

To make all paragraphs on a page blue and sized 20% bigger than normal text, we would apply this CSS rule to a page:

The codice_1 refers to all HTML elements with the codice_2 tag. The CSS is being used to change this element. The codice_3 and codice_4 are both properties and the codice_5 and codice_6 are values. Each property has a set of possible values. These values can be words or numbers.
