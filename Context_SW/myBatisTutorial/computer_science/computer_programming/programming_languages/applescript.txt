AppleScript

AppleScript is a way for people to write commands and actions on their Apple Macintosh platform. It is a simple language, like English, and is made by Apple Inc. since the year 1993. The AppleScript program came from the HyperCard program.

An example of the different ways to write a Hello World program in AppleScript:

display dialog "Hello World!" -- a modal window with "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons
-- or
display alert "Hello World!" -- a modal window with a single "Ok" button
-- or
say "Hello World!" -- an audio message using a synthesized computer voice
