LaTeX

LaTeX is a computer program used for making articles, books and mathematical formulas more aesthetically pleasing. LatTex is well-suited for expressing mathematical formulas on electronic devices in a more human readable format by allowing them to be shown in a format similar to how they would be written in many textbooks or by hand. LaTeX is used for making mathematical formulas for some articles on Wikipedia in addition to being used within academic circles.

The writer types his article into a plain text document. A plain text document cannot have styled text, like bold or italic. When the writer wants to write styled text, they use Computer Commands. For example, the command for bold text is <nowiki>\textbf{This text is bold}</nowiki>. After the writer is finished writing the article, they tell LaTeX to read the document. After LaTeX is done, LaTeX makes a file that can be printed. The command <nowiki>\textbf{This text is bold}</nowiki> would print as This text is bold.
LaTeX was first made in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport at SRI International. The current version is LaTeX2e (styled ).
