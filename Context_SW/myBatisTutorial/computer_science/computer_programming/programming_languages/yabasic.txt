Study this bit of code:
The result of this code is:
An audible beep is generated
The program waits for 1 second before going onto the next instruction
It then goes back to the start of the program creating an infinite loop.

This programming language can also be used to create rather complex programs such as one that calculates prime numbers

The "input" command asks the user to input a value which in this case is number that tells the program what number to stop finding prime numbers at.
The 
commands create a loop that can be repeated infinitely.
The
commands hold instructions as to what the program is to do while in the loop. 
The
commands tell the program to look for something and if the thing it is looking for is there then it reports back that it is there.
