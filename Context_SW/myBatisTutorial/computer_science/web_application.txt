Web application

A web application is a software application that runs on a remote server. In most cases, Web browsers are used to access Web applications, over a network, such as the Internet. Some web applications are used in intranets, in companies and schools, for example. Web applications are different from other applications because they do not need to be installed. 

Some example web applications are: Facebook (social networking), Flickr (photo sharing), Mibbit (chatting), and Wikipedia.

Web applications are popular because most computer operating systems have web browsers. Programmers can easily change a web application. Users do not need to install any new software to see these changes.
