Supervised learning

In machine learning, supervised learning is the task of inferring a function from labelled training data. The results of the training are known beforehand, the system simply learns, how to get to these results correctly. Usually, such systems work with vectors. They get the training data and the result of the training as two vectors, and produce a "classifier". Usually, the system uses inductive reasoning to generalize the training data.
