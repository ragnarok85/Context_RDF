Non-separable wavelets

Non-separable wavelets are multi-dimensional wavelets that are not implemented using one-dimensional operations.
They are studied since 1992.
In contrast to separable wavelets, the non-separable wavelets have several advantages.
For example, the non-separable filters imply more parameters in design. This consequently leads to better filters.
