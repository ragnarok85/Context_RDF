Data type

In computer science, data types or just type is a classification that differentiates data into real-valued, integer or Boolean.

Almost all programming languages explicitly include the notion of data type, though different languages may use different terminology. Common data types may include: integers, booleans, characters, floating-point numbers, and alphanumeric strings.
