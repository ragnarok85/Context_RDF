Data loss

Data loss is an event that happens when a file, program, or a piece of information is lost. When data is updated, it may change, and this may not be data loss. Data loss also does not occur when the data is unavailable for some time only, for example because the server it is stored on cannot be reached. When this server can be reached again, the data will again be there. There are some common causes to data loss. Data loss can sometimes be prevented by creating a backup copy. A backup copy may contain an older version of a file, which can make data loss less severe. If certain information used by the system is lost, the system may stop working. Getting the system working again and restoring the data from a backup copy may take a long time.

Sometimes a file or folder is accidentally (not meant to be done) deleted. Most of the time users have a special "recycling" bin to recover from, but the loss of system files can stop the system from working.

Sometimes the system could have run low on battery power and shut off automatically while saving or loading data, corrupting it.

Sometimes the system is accidentally unplugged, causing a corruption.

The user can shut the system off by themselves to corrupt unwanted data.

At any time a computer user can unplug the system and corrupt unwanted data.
