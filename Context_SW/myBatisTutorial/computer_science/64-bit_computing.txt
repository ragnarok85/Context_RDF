64-bit computing

In computer science, 64-bit computing refers to a microprocessor's data stream. It means an operating system can use more computer memory at one time. This makes a 64-bit system much faster than a 32-bit system. A 32-bit system can only use up to 3.56 gigabytes of random-access memory (called RAM or memory). A 64-bit system can use much more memory making it considerably faster. Using an analogy, a 64-bit system is like a 64 line highway. If each bit were a car, it means 64 of them can move at the same time.
