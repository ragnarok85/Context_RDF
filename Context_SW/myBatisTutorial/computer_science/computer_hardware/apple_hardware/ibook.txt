IBook

The iBook is a line of discontinued laptop computers sold by Apple Inc. between 1999 and 2006. The line was targeted at the consumer and education markets, with lower specifications and prices than the PowerBook, Apple's higher-end line of laptop computers. 

Apple replaced the iBook line with the MacBook in May 2006 during Appleâ€™s transition to Intel processors.
