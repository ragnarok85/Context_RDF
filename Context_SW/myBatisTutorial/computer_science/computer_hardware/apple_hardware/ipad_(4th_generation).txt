IPad (4th generation)

The fourth generation iPad (sold as iPad with Retina display, sometimes called the iPad 4) is a tablet computer that is made and sold by Apple Inc. The fourth generation iPad kept the same Retina display as the last generation, but added some new features such as the Apple A6X chip, and the Lightning connector, which replaced the 30-pin dock connector. It was shipped with iOS 6, but can run the latest version of iOS, which is iOS 8.

The fourth generation iPad was announced on October 16, 2012 at a media event that was held at the California Theatre in San Jose, California. It was available for pre-order online in several countries on October 26. The Wi-Fi version of the device went on sale in several countries on November 2, 2012. The cellular model went on sale a few weeks later.
On January 29, 2013, Apple announced a 128 GB version of the 4th generation iPad. It went on sale on February 5, 2013.
After the iPad Air was announced on October 22, 2013, the 4th generation iPad was discontinued. It was brought back on March 18, 2014, after the iPad 2 was discontinued.

The fourth generation iPad shipped with iOS 6.1. It can act as a hotspot, meaning that it can share its internet connection over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB. It can also access the App Store, where users can buy and install applications for their device.
