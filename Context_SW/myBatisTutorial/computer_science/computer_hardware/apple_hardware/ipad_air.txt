The iPad Air is the fifth type of iPad made by Apple Inc. It was announced at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 22, 2013. It first came with iOS 7 installed on it, but now has iOS 8.

The iPad Air was first announced at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 22, 2013. The name of the event was "We still have a lot to cover."

The iPad Air can run the newest operating system, iOS 7. It can act as a mobile hotspot, sharing its internet connection over Wi-Fi, USB, or Bluetooth. It can have access to the App Store, where users can buy and download mobile applications onto their device.
