Apple Watch

The Apple Watch is an electronic watch from Apple Inc. It has been available to buy in stores and online since early 2015.

The Apple Watch can do things like measure your heartbeat and works like a walkie-talkie when used together with an iPhone 5 or newer iPhone. It can also access the Internet to download and run apps. Because of this, many people call it a "smartwatch".

The Apple Watch will work with Apple Pay, a mobile payment service that was announced at the same event that the watch was announced. It can control the Apple TV, act as a walkie-talkie, and lets you control the iPhone camera.
