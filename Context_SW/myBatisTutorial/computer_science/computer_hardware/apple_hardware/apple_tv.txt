Apple TV

Apple TV is a digital streaming device made by Apple. Apple is a company that makes the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. There are 4 generations of the Apple TV. It can be used to stream content (for example, music, movies, TV shows, pictures etc.) from other Apple devices or iCloud to a TV.

Apple TV was first announced on September 12, 2006 under the name "iTV", however the name was changed before the final release because a UK television company named ITV threatened to sue Apple if they used the name. Sales of Apple TV started on March 21, 2007.

On January 15, 2008, Apple announced they would release a free update to the Apple TV, allowing people to download media from the iTunes Store without having to connect their Apple TV to their computer.

Apple announced a new, smaller version of the Apple TV on September 1, 2010, followed by an almost identical, but faster Apple TV on March 7, 2012.

On September 9, 2015, at WWDC, Apple announced the 4th generation Apple TV. It features a new Siri remote, and an App Store, as part of TVOS 9.0.
