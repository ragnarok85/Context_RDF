IPad Mini 2

The second generation iPad Mini (stylized and marketed as iPad Mini 2, and previously marketed as the iPad mini with Retina display) is a tablet computer that is made and sold by Apple Inc. It almost has the same design as the first generation iPad Mini, but added some new features such as the Apple A7 system-on-a-chip and a 2,048 x 1,536 resolution Retina Display. It uses the same hardware that is used in the iPad Air. Apple released the second generation iPad Mini in silver and space grey colors on November 12, 2013.

The successor to the iPad Mini 2, the iPad Mini 3, was announced on October 16, 2014.

The iPad Mini 2 was announced during an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 22, 2013. The theme of the event was 'We still have a lot to cover.' Originally, at the time of its release, the iPad Mini 2 was officially sold as the "iPad Mini with Retina Display". However, when the iPad Mini 3 was announced on October 16, 2014, Apple started selling the second generation iPad Mini as iPad Mini 2.
