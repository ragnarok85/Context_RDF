Apple A4

The Apple A4 is a microprocessor designed by Apple and manufactured by Samsung and first used in the iPad tablet computer, then in the iPhone 4 smartphone. It was also used in the iPod Touch (4th generation).

Apple announced the A4 on January 27, 2010, during their "Latest Creation" event.

On June 7, 2010, Steve Jobs publicly confirmed that the iPhone 4 would contain the A4 Processor, although it was not yet known if it had the same frequency, bus width, or caches as the A4 in the iPad.
