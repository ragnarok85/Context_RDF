Free Speech Flag

The Free Speech Flag is a symbol to promote freedom of speech. It was designed by artist John Marcotte. It was created on May 1, 2007, during a conflict on the Internet with the group AACS. AACS controlled a code to copy HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. The design of the flag and its colors correspond to that special code. It became popular on the Internet. It inspired other versions.
