Intel Core

Intel Core is the name of a family of 32-bit dual-core microprocessors. It was made by the technology company Intel. Intel Core processors are based on Pentium M technology. Those processors are more advanced than Intel P6 processors. This architecture, or way to build a processor, is now replaced by Core 2 microarchitecture. In the Core family, there are two groups: the Duo (with two cores) and Solo (Duo with one disabled core). The Solo line replaced the Pentium M one-core processor.

September 2006 and January 4, 2008 were times when many Core CPUs stopped selling.

Yonah is a company name for Intel's first generation of microprocessors for mobile computers. The Core Duo was released on 5 January 2006. It was the first Intel processor to be used in Apple Inc.'s Macintosh computers. Yonah does not have 64-bit function.

The Intel Core Duo has two cores, 2 Mebibytes of L2 cache for both cores, and an arbiter bus that controls the L2 cache and front side bus access.

The Intel Core Solo uses two-cores die as a Core Duo, but one core is turned off.


The duo version of Intel Core (Yonah) has two cores, which give performance per watt almost as good as single-core processors. In computer machines operating with batteries, this means getting as much total work done in one battery charge like in old computers.

The shortcomings of Intel Core (Yonah) are:

Core-based processor Intel Xeon Sossaman LV (low-voltage), for servers also does not have the Intel 64-bit function. All new server systems have support for x86-64, and Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 even requires a 64-bit processor to run.

On July 27, 2006, Intel released newer Core version Intel Core 2.
